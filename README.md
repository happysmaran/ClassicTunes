After the several minor changes made to the Music app in macOS 26 made it worse to use than before, I tried to use older iTunes versions on a modern Macbook. Unfortunately, starting with Tahoe, that has begun to change, with most solutions to running older software going out. And as such, I decided to make my own completely from scratch using Swift and SwiftUI.

**ClassicTunes** is an Apple Silicon made app that emulates the classic designs of iTunes 7-10, featuring:

- Working CoverFlow
- Playlists
- MiniPlayer
- Overall iTunes 7-10 aesthetics

I ran out of things to say.
